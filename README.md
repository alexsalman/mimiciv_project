## Abstract

The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI)‚Äìdriven clinical decision support systems has improved healthcare automation, yet most rely on cloud-based models, raising concerns about data privacy, latency, and accessibility in resource-constrained settings. We present a fully offline AI-powered patient-level question-and-answer (Q&A) system that integrates modular agents and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with on-premise large language models (LLMs) for clinical summarization and diagnostic support, built on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV v3.1) dataset. We preprocess 6,365,019 intensive care unit (ICU) admission summaries into 384-dimensional embeddings using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 Sentence-Transformer and index them with facebook AI similarity search (FAISS) in a hierarchical navigable small world flat (HNSWFlat) structure (M=32, efConstruction=200) at roughly 145 records/s to enable sub-second nearest-neighbor retrieval. A Retrieval Agent fetches relevant patient history, vital signs, and laboratory results; a Summarization Agent (Mistral) converts structured data into concise, coherent narratives; and a Diagnosis Agent (Gemma) proposes likely conditions from those narratives. We record clinician-provided gold-standard notes alongside each model response and employ a hybrid feedback scorer‚Äîcombining expert-weighted clinical keywords with international classification of diseases (ICD) keyword matches‚Äîto refine outputs (scores capped at 1.0). In a held-out evaluation on 24 real-world clinical queries, our offline framework achieves competitive retrieval precision, recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation (ROUGE-L) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers score (BERTScore) summary quality, and top-3 diagnostic accuracy‚Äîwhile guaranteeing full on-site data residency and zero reliance on external application programming interfaces (APIs). This work demonstrates that sub-8 billion-parameter LLMs can deliver secure, explainable clinical Q\&A entirely offline, paving the way for deployment in privacy-sensitive or connectivity-limited healthcare environments. Future work will explore fine-tuning on medical corpora and dynamic agent orchestration for real-time hospital integration.
